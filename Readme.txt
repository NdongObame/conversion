Practice: Conversions of measurement units

Write an algorithm that alternately asks the user to enter the conversion domain,
the starting unit, the ending unit and finally the value to be converted. Then after performing
conversion, the algorithm displays the result of the conversion on the screen.

Take as domain of conversion: digital capacity, mass, length, area and volume.
And for each conversion domain, work with all their conversion units.
